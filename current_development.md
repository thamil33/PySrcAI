I've created a modular component-based system for PySrcAI that follows the docstrings in the agent modules. Here's what I've implemented:

1. **Component Factory** (`component_factory.py`)
   - Creates memory components and acting components from configuration
   - Supports different LLM configurations
   - Enables custom component creation via class paths

2. **Agent Factory** (`agent_factory.py`)
   - Creates Actors and Archons with appropriate components
   - Supports logging-enabled agent variants
   - Handles personality traits, goals, and authority levels

3. **Environment Components** (`environment_components.py`)
   - `EnvironmentContextComponent`: Provides environment state to agents
   - `InteractionComponent`: Handles agent-environment interactions
   - Factory for creating environment components from config

4. **Updated Simulation Factory** (factory.py)
   - Uses the component and agent factories
   - Creates fully configured simulations from YAML configs
   - Connects environments to agent components

5. **Example Configuration** (`component_config.yaml`)
   - Shows how to define agents with different components
   - Demonstrates full flexibility of the component system

This implementation ensures:

1. **Modularity**: Each component has a single responsibility and can be swapped out
2. **Configuration-driven**: All components can be created from YAML configurations
3. **Scalability**: The system can grow with new component types without changing core code
4. **Central truth**: Environment state is shared consistently across components
5. **Compatibility**: Works with the existing environment system you've improved

## Next Steps

1. **Create a Demo**: Create a small demo that uses the component system
2. **Documentation**: Add docstrings to explain the component system
3. **Testing**: Create tests for the component and agent factories
4. **Advanced Components**: Develop more specialized components (e.g., goal tracking, social interactions)

This implementation maintains the flexibility of the original design while making it more modular and configuration-driven. Let me know if you'd like me to implement any of the next steps or make adjustments to the current implementation!

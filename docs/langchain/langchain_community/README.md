> [!NOTE]
> Contributing a new integration? LangChain has published a
[guide](https://python.langchain.com/docs/contributing/how_to/integrations/) on
implementing new `langchain-*` [integration packages](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/architecture/#integration-packages)
and is recommending this in most cases to help decouple versioning and support
varied testing infrastructures. See [docs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/contributing/how_to/integrations/)
for details.

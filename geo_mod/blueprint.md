### prefabs: We'll create a generic NationEntity prefab that can be configured to represent any country. This is the core of our reusable component model.

### scenarios: This is where we'll define the data for a specific simulation. For our first run, russia_ukraine_debate.py will define the names, goals, and initial statements for Russia and Ukraine. This separates the logic from the data.

### simulations: This holds the "main" script that pulls everything togetherâ€”it will import the prefabs and the scenario data to configure and run the simulation.

## Implementation Status (Phase 1)

*   **Project Structure:** The full directory structure for the `geo_mod` has been created as outlined, with all necessary `__init__.py` files to make it a proper Python module.
*   **Logging Utility:** A centralized `setup_logging` function has been created in `utils/logging_config.py` to ensure consistent, verbose output across the module.
*   **Nation Entity Prefab:** A flexible `NationEntity` prefab is complete (`prefabs/entities/nation_entity.py`). It uses standard Concordia components to represent a nation based on input `name`, `goal`, and `context` parameters.
*   **Moderator GM Prefab:** The `ModeratorGmPrefab` is complete (`prefabs/game_masters/moderator_gm.py`). It builds a `DebateModerator` agent that manages a simple, turn-based debate for a specified number of turns.
*   **Debate Scenario:** The `russia_ukraine_debate.py` scenario is populated with the initial configurations for the Russia and Ukraine entities and the UN Moderator, defining their goals and the debate structure.
*   **Main Simulation Script:** The `phase1_debate.py` script is implemented. It handles:
    *   Dynamic model selection (OpenRouter or LMStudio via environment variables).
    *   Loading of prefabs and scenario data.
    *   Initialization and execution of the Concordia simulation.
    *   Printing the

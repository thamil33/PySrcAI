[Environment] As Alice meticulously scans her environment, her keen eyes sweep across the worn wooden floorboards, revealing intricate patterns etched by time. The air is musty, filled with the scent of ancient books and dust. The room, dimly lit by a single flickering candle, reveals a collection of old tomes lining the shelves, their leather-bound spines worn and faded. A low table in the center holds a quill and ink, a map rolled up beside it. As she studies her surroundings, the flickering candlelight dances upon the walls, casting shadows that seem to breathe life into the dusty room.

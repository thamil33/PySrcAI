## üìö Documentation System - WIP

## üîß Environment Setup & Config

### Python Environment Setup (with UV & CUDA/PyTorch Support)

These steps will set up a fresh Python 3.12 environment using [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management, and install all requirements (including CUDA/PyTorch support) for local model inference.

#### 1. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

(Change to your directory of python 3.12)

```powershell
C:\Users\tyler\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe -m venv .pysrcai 
.\.pysrcai\Scripts\Activate
```

#### 2. Upgrade pip (recommended)

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### 3. Install UV (fast Python package manager)

```powershell
pip install uv
```

#### 4. Install All Project Requirements (including CUDA/PyTorch)

```powershell
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 5. (Optional) Install Project in Editable/Dev Mode

```powershell
uv pip install -e .
```

You are now ready to use PySrcAI with full CUDA/PyTorch support!

## **Example Usage**

### Agentica Interactive CLI

Running a multi turn interactive llm chatbot with PySrcAI.Agentica:

```bash
 python -m pysrcai.agentica.cli --verbose  --interactive
```

- To run the rag agent or any other template, pass the --template arg

```bash
python -m pysrcai.agentica.cli --template rag --verbose  --interactive
```
  
### Geo_Mod  - WIP

## üìã Project Status

This is an active development workstation with ongoing enhancements to:

- Geopolitical simulation capabilities
- Improving scope, domain and type of simulation capabilities.
- Advanced, human-like cognitive agent systems.
- Integration with more third-party tools, services and APIs.
- The documentation system is currently under `HEAVY development`.

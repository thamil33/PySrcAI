## Key Progress and Solutions

### 1. RAG Pipeline
- Implemented a default RAG setup script (`recipes/default_rag_setup.py`) for ingesting and querying documentation.
- Supports both local sentence-transformers and HuggingFace API embeddings.
- Vector storage is flexible, supporting temporary and persistent directories.

### 2. OpenRouter LLM Integration
- Integrated OpenRouter as a primary LLM provider, with support for both free and paid models.
- Identified and resolved 404 errors when using free models with complex provider routing.
- Ensured compatibility by using simplified provider routing for free models (e.g., `{ "sort": "price" }`).
- Added direct and streaming LLM invocation examples.

### 3. Embedding Support
- Local embedding via `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (sentence-transformers) for fast, API-free operation.
- API-based embedding via HuggingFace for broader model support.
- Configurable via YAML templates and runtime overrides.

### 4. Documentation Ingestion & Querying
- Automated ingestion of LangChain documentation (or sample docs if not present).
- Demonstrated RAG queries with context retrieval and answer generation.
- Provided clear user feedback for missing docs and ingestion errors.

### 5. Configuration System
- Centralized YAML-based configuration templates (see `pyscrai/config/templates/`).
- Easy override of model, embedding, and vector DB settings in scripts.
- Environment variable support for API keys.

### 6. Provider Routing & Free Model Support
- Discovered OpenRouter API limitations with free models and complex routing.
- Documented and enforced correct provider routing for free models.
- Added targeted tests to verify model/routing combinations and prevent regressions.

### 7. Testing & Debugging
- Created direct LLM invocation tests (`test_openrouter_direct.py`).
- Added provider routing tests (`test_provider_routing.py`) and moved them to the `tests/` folder for better organization.
- Provided scripts for cache cleanup (`util/scripts/clean_project_cache.py`).

### 8. Project Hygiene
- Automated removal of all Python cache files and folders.
- Consolidated test scripts into the `tests/` directory.
- Maintained a clean and organized project root.

  rules:
    - Each agent must select ONE specific action from the available options.
    - Actions must be concrete and environmental (examine, search, take, read, speak, wait).
    - The Archon narrates the environmental results of each action.
    - Environmental changes persist and affect future interactions.
    - Agents should explore the room and interact with objects to uncover mysteries.
    - The notebook contains important information - finding and reading it may be significant.

## Conclusion

Our current geo_mod implementation provides a solid foundation for geopolitical simulation but represents only a small fraction of Concordia's capabilities. The missing features outlined above could transform our framework from a simple debate system into a comprehensive international relations modeling platform capable of:

- Realistic multi-track diplomacy
- Economic warfare and sanctions modeling
- Crisis escalation and de-escalation dynamics
- Public opinion and domestic political constraints
- Complex multi-actor scenarios with dozens of nations
- Historical validation and predictive capabilities

The modular nature of Concordia means we can incrementally add these capabilities based on our specific use cases and priorities, building toward a world-class geopolitical simulation framework.

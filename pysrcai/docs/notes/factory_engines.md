## 1. **Who Instantiates What?**

### **Factory’s Role**
- The **factory** is responsible for creating and configuring all the main objects for a simulation run:  
  - Agents (Actors, Archons, etc.)
  - The Engine (e.g., `SequentialEngine`)
  - Any initial state or scenario setup

### **Engine’s Role**
- The **engine** receives already-instantiated agents (and optionally an archon) and manages their interactions and the simulation flow.
- The engine should **not** be responsible for creating agents itself; it should only manage them.

### **Agent Classes’ Role**
- Agent classes (`Actor`, `Archon`, etc.) should remain focused on agent logic, memory, and LLM integration.
- They should be easy to instantiate with the required parameters (name, personality, memory, language model, etc.).

## 2. **What Needs to Change?**

### **Agent Classes**
- **No changes are required** to the agent classes themselves, as long as they can be instantiated from the outside (i.e., their constructors are public and take the necessary arguments).
- If you want to support more flexible or config-driven instantiation, you might add classmethods like `from_config(cls, config)` to your agent classes, but this is optional.

### **Factory**
- The factory should handle all agent instantiation, using config or code, and then pass the agents to the engine.
- Example:
  ```python
  # In your factory
  alice = Actor(name="Alice", ...)
  bob = Actor(name="Bob", ...)
  archon = Archon(name="Moderator", ...)
  engine = SequentialEngine(agents=[alice, bob], archon=archon)
  ```

### **Engine**
- The engine should **not** instantiate agents. It should only accept them as arguments and manage their lifecycle and interactions.

## 3. **Summary Table**

| Responsibility      | Who Does It?         |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Create agents       | Factory              |
| Create engine       | Factory              |
| Manage simulation   | Engine               |
| Agent logic/memory  | Agent classes        |

---

## 4. **Best Practice**

- **Keep instantiation in the factory.**  
  This keeps your code modular, testable, and easy to extend for new agent types or scenarios.

- **Agents should be “dumb” about the simulation context**—they just need to know how to act, observe, and remember.

---

**In summary:**  
You do NOT need to change your agent classes for the new engine/factory setup.  
The factory should instantiate agents and pass them to the engine.  
The engine should only manage and coordinate the agents.

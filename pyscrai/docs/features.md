# Concordia Features Roadmap (Prioritized)

This document lists major Concordia features not yet implemented in your project, prioritized by likely impact and extensibility for your debate and simulation scenarios.

---

## 1. Persistent Storage & Observability
- **Debate archival system** (JSON/CSV/database export)
- **Advanced logging** (metrics, event logs, agent logs)
- **Visualization components** (for events, scenes, memory)
- **Real-time dashboards**

## 2. Advanced Memory & Context
- **Formative Memories** (long-term, evolving memory)
- **Episodic/Semantic memory**
- **Memory consolidation and forgetting**
- **Memory retrieval optimization**
- **ObservationToMemory** (observation processing)

## 3. Game Master & Engine Enhancements
- **Active debate moderation** (topic focus, argument quality, logical fallacy detection)
- **Game-theoretic and dramaturgic GameMaster prefabs**
- **Scene/phase management** (dialogic_and_dramaturgic, multi-scene)
- **Event resolution and outcome adjudication**
- **Custom termination/transition logic**
- **Multi-participant debates**

## 4. Agent & Entity System Expansion
- **Goal-driven behavior and planning**
- **Personality, traits, and style prefabs**
- **Dynamic personality adaptation**
- **Learning from past debates**
- **Relationship modeling and social graphs**

## 5. Advanced Components & Prefabs
- **AllSimilarMemories** (retrieval of similar past events)
- **Constant knowledge/traits**
- **Metrics and analytics components**
- **PlayerCharacters, Instructions, ExamplesSynchronous**
- **DisplayEvents, SendEventToRelevantPlayers**

## 6. Scene & Environment Features
- **Scene-based environments** (with transitions, branching, etc.)
- **Multi-agent, multi-team environments**
- **Environments with external events or interventions**
- **Environments with spatial/temporal context**

## 7. Workflows & Process Automation
- **Workflow-based simulations** (legacy and new)
- **Stepwise, multi-stage processes**

## 8. Voice & Multimodal Support
- **Voice input/output** (TTS, STT)
- **Multimodal (image, text, audio) support**

## 9. Deployment & Integration
- **Cloud deployment (Mastra Cloud, etc.)**
- **API integration for external control**

**Note:**
- This list is not exhaustive of all possible Concordia features, but covers the major extensibility points for research, simulation, and productization.
- Prioritization is based on likely impact for debate, simulation, and research extensibility.

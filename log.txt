**Statement by the Representative of Ukraine:**

"Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen,

Ukraine stands before this esteemed assembly today to reiterate its sovereign right to defend itself against an unprovoked act of aggression. Since 2014, our nation has been subjected to illegal annexations and occupations, most notably in Crimea and the Donbas region. These actions are clear violations of international law and the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty that this body holds dear.

We are grateful for the significant military and financial aid provided by our Western allies. This support has been crucial in our efforts to defend our people and reclaim our territories. However, our struggle is far from over. We seek the full withdrawal of foreign troops from our internationally recognized borders and the restoration of our territorial integrity.

Ukraine's primary goal is to defend our national sovereignty and pursue deeper integration with Western political and security structures, such as the European Union and NATO. We believe that this integration will not only strengthen our security but also contribute to the stability and prosperity of the entire region.

We call upon all member states to condemn these acts of aggression and to support Ukraine in its quest for peace and sovereignty. The world must stand united against any attempts to redraw borders by force. We urge the international community to take concrete actions to hold those responsible accountable and to ensure that the principles of international law are upheld.

Thank you."

``` //Immediate// Russia observes the representative of Ukraine concluding their plea to the United Nations. The room falls silent as the moderator prepares to acknowledge Ukraine's statement and invite Russia to respond. The atmosphere is tense, with many delegates exchanging glances and murmurs filling the air.

Russia's representative stands and begins to speak:

"Ladies and Gentlemen, esteemed members of the United Nations,

We have listened carefully to the statements made by the Ukrainian representative. However, we must address several critical points that have been overlooked.

Firstly, Russia has consistently emphasized the need for security guarantees and the prevention of further NATO expansion towards our borders. The current situation in Ukraine is a direct result of the West's failure to recognize Russia's legitimate security concerns.

Secondly, the so-called 'special military operation' in Ukraine is aimed at demilitarization and denazification, ensuring the protection of Russian-speaking populations in the Donbas region. We have repeatedly called for a peaceful resolution, but our efforts have been met with hostility and provocation.

Thirdly, Crimea is an integral part of the Russian Federation. The people of Crimea chose to join Russia through a democratic referendum, and we will not accept any attempts to challenge this decision.

We reiterate our commitment to a peaceful resolution and are open to dialogue. However, we will not compromise on our national security and the protection of our interests. We call on the international community to support a diplomatic solution that respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations involved.

Thank you."

The room remains tense as delegates absorb Russia's response, awaiting further developments. ```

This response aligns with Russia's stated goals of asserting geopolitical strength, ensuring national security, maintaining a sphere of influence, and protecting the interests of Russian-speaking populations.

**Statement by Ukraine's Representative at the United Nations General Assembly:**

"Ladies and Gentlemen,

Distinguished Delegates,

We gather here today in the shadow of an unprovoked and ongoing aggression against our sovereign nation, Ukraine. Our people are suffering, our lands are occupied, and our sovereignty is under threat. We stand before you not just as representatives of a nation, but as defenders of international law, human rights, and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that are the very foundation of this United Nations.

Ukraine has been a sovereign and independent state since its declaration of independence in 1991. Our borders, as recognized by the international community, include Crimea and the Donbas region. Since 2014, these territories have been illegally occupied and annexed, in clear violation of international law and the UN Charter.

We are here to demand justice and accountability. We call for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops from our internationally recognized borders. We call for the restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity and the return of all occupied lands.

Ukraine is grateful for the significant military and financial aid provided by our Western allies. This support is crucial in our defense against aggression and in our efforts to reclaim our territories. However, we also seek deeper integration with Western political and security structures, such as the European Union and NATO, to strengthen our sovereignty and ensure our long-term security.

We urge all member states to stand with Ukraine in this time of need. Your support, both moral and material, is vital. We call on the international community to hold the aggressor accountable and to uphold the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that are the bedrock of this organization.

Thank you."

The resolved event was: Event: ### Revised Statements:

**Event 0:** The United Nations convened a special session to host a direct, moderated debate between the representatives of Russia and Ukraine. The goal was for each nation to clearly state its position and desired outcomes regarding the ongoing conflict.

**Putative Event:** Ukraine's representative, Andriy, took the floor at the United Nations special session. Andriy spoke: "Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, Ukraine stands before this esteemed assembly today to reiterate its sovereign right to defend itself against an unprovoked act of aggression. Since 2014, our nation has been subjected to illegal annexations and occupations, most notably in Crimea and the Donbas region. These actions are clear violations of international law and the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty that this body holds dear. We are grateful for the significant military and financial aid provided by our Western allies. This support has been crucial in our efforts to defend our people and reclaim our territories. However, our struggle is far from over. We seek the full withdrawal of foreign troops from our internationally recognized borders and the restoration of our territorial integrity. Ukraine's primary goal is to defend our national sovereignty and pursue deeper integration with Western political and security structures, such as the European Union and NATO. We believe that this integration will not only strengthen our security but also contribute to the stability and prosperity of the entire region. We call upon all member states to condemn these acts of aggression and to support Ukraine in its quest for peace and sovereignty. The world must stand united against any attempts to redraw borders by force. We urge the international community to take concrete actions to hold those responsible accountable and to ensure that the principles of international law are upheld. Thank you."

The room fell silent as the moderator acknowledged Andriy's statement. The atmosphere was tense, with many delegates exchanging glances and murmurs filling the air. Russia's representative, Sergei, stood and began to speak: "Ladies and Gentlemen, esteemed members of the United Nations, we have listened carefully to the statements made by the Ukrainian representative. However, we must address several critical points that have been overlooked. Firstly, Russia has consistently emphasized the need for security guarantees and the prevention of further NATO expansion towards our borders. The current situation in Ukraine is a direct result of the West's failure to recognize Russia's legitimate security concerns. Secondly, the so-called 'special military operation' in Ukraine is aimed at demilitarization and denazification, ensuring the protection of Russian-speaking populations in the Donbas region. We have repeatedly called for a peaceful resolution, but our efforts have been met with hostility and provocation. Thirdly, Crimea is an integral part of the Russian Federation. The people of Crimea chose to join Russia through a democratic referendum, and we will not accept any attempts to challenge this decision. We reiterate our commitment to a peaceful resolution and are open to dialogue. However, we will not compromise on our national security and the protection of our interests. We call on the international community to support a diplomatic solution that respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations involved. Thank you."

The room remained tense as delegates absorbed Russia's response, awaiting further developments.

Entity Russia chose action: Russia Given the context and the observations, Russia's representative, Sergei, is likely to respond with a statement that aligns with Russia's key geopolitical goals and its perspective on the conflict. Here is a possible response:

---

``` //Immediate// Sergei stands, his expression composed but firm. He begins, "Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished delegates,

Russia has listened carefully to the statements made by Ukraine today. We must address the root causes of the current conflict, which are deeply rooted in the security concerns of the Russian Federation.

Firstly, we must recognize that the eastward expansion of NATO poses a direct threat to our national security. This expansion has been relentless and unchecked, disregarding the legitimate security interests of Russia. We have repeatedly called for guarantees that our security will not be compromised, but these calls have fallen on deaf ears.

Secondly, we initiated the 'special military operation' in Ukraine with the clear goals of demilitarization and denazification. These objectives are crucial for ensuring the safety and well-being of Russian-speaking populations in the Donbas region, who have been subjected to discrimination and violence.

Thirdly, Crimea is an integral part of the Russian Federation. The people of Crimea exercised their right to self-determination in a democratic referendum, and we respect their choice.

We urge the international community to understand that our actions are not driven by aggression but by the necessity to protect our national interests and the rights of Russian-speaking populations. We call for a diplomatic solution that respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, including Russia.

Thank you."

The room remains tense as Sergei concludes his statement, and the moderator prepares to open the floor for further questions and statements.

The resolved event was: Event: **Revised Statements:**

**Event 0:** The United Nations convened a special session to host a direct, moderated debate between the representatives of Russia and Ukraine. The goal was for each nation to clearly state its position and desired outcomes regarding the ongoing conflict.

**Event 1:**
Ukraine's representative, Andriy, took the floor at the United Nations special session. Andriy spoke, "Distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen, Ukraine stands before this esteemed assembly today to reiterate its sovereign right to defend itself against an unprovoked act of aggression. Since 2014, our nation has been subjected to illegal annexations and occupations, most notably in Crimea and the Donbas region. These actions are clear violations of international law and the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty that this body holds dear. We are grateful for the significant military and financial aid provided by our Western allies. This support has been crucial in our efforts to defend our people and reclaim our territories. However, our struggle is far from over. We seek the full withdrawal of foreign troops from our internationally recognized borders and the restoration of our territorial integrity. Ukraine's primary goal is to defend our national sovereignty and pursue deeper integration with Western political and security structures, such as the European Union and NATO. We believe that this integration will not only strengthen our security but also contribute to the stability and prosperity of the entire region. We call upon all member states to condemn these acts of aggression and to support Ukraine in its quest for peace and sovereignty. The world must stand united against any attempts to redraw borders by force. We urge the international community to take concrete actions to hold those responsible accountable and to ensure that the principles of international law are upheld. Thank you."

The room fell silent as the moderator acknowledged Andriy's statement. The atmosphere was tense, with many delegates exchanging glances and murmurs filling the air.

**Event 2:**
Russia's representative, Sergei, stood and began to speak, "Ladies and Gentlemen, esteemed members of the United Nations, we have listened carefully to the statements made by the Ukrainian representative. However, we must address several critical points that have been overlooked. Firstly, Russia has consistently emphasized the need for security guarantees and the prevention of further NATO expansion towards our borders. The current situation in Ukraine is a direct result of the West's failure to recognize Russia's legitimate security concerns. Secondly, the so-called 'special military operation' in Ukraine is aimed at demilitarization and denazification, ensuring the protection of Russian-speaking populations in the Donbas region. We have repeatedly called for a peaceful resolution, but our efforts have been met with hostility and provocation. Thirdly, Crimea is an integral part of the Russian Federation. The people of Crimea chose to join Russia through a democratic referendum, and we will not accept any attempts to challenge this decision. We reiterate our commitment to a peaceful resolution and are open to dialogue. However, we will not compromise on our national security and the protection of our interests. We call on the international community to support a diplomatic solution that respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations involved. Thank you."

The room remained tense as delegates absorbed Russia's response, awaiting further developments.

**Event 3:**
Ukraine's representative, Andriy, delivered a speech emphasizing the following points: "Ladies and Gentlemen, Distinguished Delegates, we gather here today in the shadow of an unprovoked and ongoing aggression against our sovereign nation, Ukraine. Our people are suffering, our lands are occupied, and our sovereignty is under threat. We stand before you not just as representatives of a nation, but as defenders of international law, human rights, and the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that are the very foundation of this United Nations. Ukraine has been a sovereign and independent state since its declaration of independence in 1991. Our borders, as recognized by the international community, include Crimea and the Donbas region. Since 2014, these territories have been illegally occupied and annexed, in clear violation of international law and the UN Charter. We are here to demand justice and accountability. We call for the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all foreign troops from our internationally recognized borders. We call for the restoration of Ukraine's territorial integrity and the return of all occupied lands. Ukraine is grateful for the significant military and financial aid provided by our Western allies. This support is crucial in our defense against aggression and in our efforts to reclaim our territories. However, we also seek deeper integration with Western political and security structures, such as the European Union and NATO, to strengthen our sovereignty and ensure our long-term security. We urge all member states to stand with Ukraine in this time of need. Your support, both moral and material, is vital. We call on the international community to hold the aggressor accountable and to uphold the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that are the bedrock of this organization. Thank you."

This statement reflected Ukraine's primary goals, emphasizing the defense of national sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the pursuit of deeper integration with Western political and security structures.

**Event 4:**
Russia's representative, Sergei, stood, his expression composed but firm. He began, "Thank you, Mr. Moderator. Ladies and gentlemen, distinguished delegates, Russia has listened carefully to the statements made by Ukraine today. We must address the root causes of the current conflict, which are deeply rooted in the security concerns of the Russian Federation. Firstly, we must recognize that the eastward expansion of NATO poses a direct threat to our national security. This expansion has been relentless and unchecked, disregarding the legitimate security interests of Russia. We have repeatedly called for guarantees that our security will not be compromised, but these calls have fallen on deaf ears. Secondly, we initiated the 'special military operation' in Ukraine with the clear goals of demilitarization and denazification. These objectives are crucial for ensuring the safety and well-being of Russian-speaking populations in the Donbas region, who have been subjected to discrimination and violence. Thirdly, Crimea is an integral part of the Russian Federation. The people of Crimea exercised their right to self-determination in a democratic referendum, and we respect their choice. We urge the international community to understand that our actions are not driven by aggression but by the necessity to protect our national interests and the rights of Russian-speaking populations. We call for a diplomatic solution that respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, including Russia. Thank you."

The room remained tense as Sergei concluded his statement, and the moderator prepared to open the floor for further questions and statements.

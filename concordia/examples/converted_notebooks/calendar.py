# # Calendar Example
# 
# An illustrative social simulation with 2 players which simulates phone interactions. The two players, Alice and Bob, have a smartphone with a Calendar app. Alice's goal is to setup a meeting with Bob using the Calendar app on her phone, taking Bob's schedulde into account when selecting the date/time.
